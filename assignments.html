<br><h2>Programming Assignments</h2>

All assignments are due at 11:59pm of their assigned days.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="a1.html">Assignment 1</a>: Sequential Map/Reduce (due Wednesday, September 20)</li>
<li> <a href="a2.html">Assignment 2</a>: Distributed Map/Reduce (due Sunday, October 15)</li>
<li> <a href="a3.html">Assignment 3</a>: Raft (due Wednesday, November 8)</li>
<li> <a href="a4.html">Assignment 4</a>: Key-Value Storage Service (due Wednesday, December 6)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup your Go environment</h2>

Please follow <a href="setup.html">these instructions</a> for setting up for Go environment for assignments, as well as pointers to some necessary/useful tools.

<a name="submission">
<h2>Assignment Submission</h2></a>

We will use <a>Blackboard</a> to submit assignments.  Please follow the instructions given in each assignment for testing and submitting your work.

<h2>Late Submission</h2>

<p>You should submit your work on an assignment (electronically)
before its due time.  All assignments will be due at 11:59pm on their
selected days. </p>

<p>You have a total of 72 late hours to use throughout the semester (but not
beyond December 6). After you have used up your late hours, each additional
day late will incur a 10% lateness penalty (1 minute late counts as 1 day
late). Submissions late by 3 days or more will no longer be accepted. Friday
and Saturday both count as days. (Late days are tracked automatically, so you
don't need to email before using one.)</p>

<p>We will grant no-penalty extensions only in the case of illness (with a
doctor's note) or extraordinary circumstances (with the involvement of
the dean of your residential college). If illness or an extraordinary
circumstance will cause you to submit an assignment late, then you
should discuss the matter with your instructor as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Please plan your work on the assignments so that travel,
interviews, athletics, touring, student clubs, extracurricular
activities, holidays, etc. do not cause you to submit it
late. None of the above reasons nor a heavy academic workload
constitute an extraordinary circumstance.</p>

<h2>Coding Style</h2>

<p>All of the code you turn in for this course should have good style.
Make sure that your code has proper indentation, descriptive comments,
and a comment header at the beginning of each file, which includes
your name, username, and a description of the file.</p>

<p>A portion of credit for each assignment is determined by code
quality tests, using the standard tools <tt>gofmt</tt> and <tt>go
vet</tt>.  You will receive full credit for this portion if all files
submitted conform to the style standards set by <tt>gofmt</tt> and the
report from <tt>go vet</tt> is clean (that is, produces no errors).
If your code does not pass the <tt>gofmt</tt> test, you should
reformat your code using the tool. You can also use the <a
href="https://github.com/qiniu/checkstyle">Go Checkstyle</a> tool for
advice to improve your code's style, if applicable.  Additionally,
though not part of the graded cheks, it would also be advisable to
produce code that complies with <a
href="https://github.com/golang/lint">Golint</a> where possible. </p>

<h2>Version Control through Bitbucket</h2>

<p>Because accidents can happen and it is good practice, we require
you to use a version control system to maintain your code for this
course.  We ask that you setup an account with <a
href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>, a web-based hosting
service for projects that use the git revision control
system. Bitbucket allows you to have an unlimited number of free
private repositories, so please take advantage of this and <b>do not make
your code public</b>. We have put together instructions on how to set up
an account with Bitbucket as well as pointers on how to use git.
Alternately, you may use a similar service called
<a href="https://www.github.com/">Github</a>, which provides a
<a href="https://education.github.com/">Student Developer Pack</a>
that is free for students.</p>

<p><i>Commit and push your changes often.  You alone bear the
responsibility in making regular data backups, so that you don't lose
your data.</i></p>

<h3>Instructions for setting up a Bitbucket account</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Visit <a href="https://bitbucket.org/account/signup">the SignUp page</a>.</li>
<li>Either signup with a personal account, or signup using a Google account.</li>
<li>Confirm your email address.</li>
<li>You're good to go!</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> If you want to access your repository via SSH you will have to setup SSH for git. <a href=" https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git">Here's how</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>How do I git?</h3>
This page has some useful tutorials on git: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial">Git Tutorials</a></br>
In particular, tutorials 1 and 5 will be most useful for this course.</p>

<p>The basic git workflow in the shell (assuming you already have a repo set up):</br>
<ul>
<li>git pull</li>
<li>do some work</li>
<li>git status (shows what has changed)</li>
<li>git add <i>all files you want to commit</i></li>
<li>git commit -m "brief message on your update"</li>
<li>git push</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101">Bitbucket 101</a> is another good resource.</p>

<H2>Collaboration Policy</H2>

<p> Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process.
Individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and
discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with
friends are encouraged.  However, when the time comes to write the
code that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer
appropriate; the program must be your own work.</p>

<p> Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's program,
comments, README description, or any part of the submitted assignment.
This includes character-by-character transliteration of another works
(whether inspected visually or copied digitally), but it also includes
derivative works (i.e., by renaming variable names or subtly shifting
around statements in order to try to hide that copying has occurrred).
You are also not allowed to use other people's code, comments, or
results, even when "citing" them -- all work must be your own.  This
includes work done by other KAUST students this or past semesters,
as well as any other code you find online.</p>

<p>Writing code for use by another or using another's code in any form
is academic fraud and will be dealt with firmly according to
KAUST's disciplinary policies. You are also responsible for
ensuring that the code you write for the assignments is not readable
by others, which includes sharing with students in future years or
posting publicly on the Internet.</p>
